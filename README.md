# Practice

This repository is simply for me to learn and understand github

Command Line Commands:
git clone /
git add /
git commit /
git push /
git pull 

(^^ IN that order^^)


GitHub make sense and I will be needing it for ROBOTICS in order to push fixes and to create all the SubSystems and DriveSystems
